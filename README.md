User based chatbot with simple callback/response feedback loop. Very elementary and simple talk. Has one feature to go nerd about sharks when prompted with a keyword but I will leave that to be found. The code runs by you starting with a simple statement. Once that statement is made the chatbot will filter it though a series of contains loops. The contains loop will fillet by key words and phrases until it finds one that fits it, whenm found the chatbot responds to you. If there is no keyword or phrase found, the chatbot will not reply with anything and just prompt you to reenter an input. It is a very basic dictionary and very limited. Try to stick to small talk, most advanced conversations will either give a weird reply because of it containing a key word, or will just not reply at all.

For the aichatbot.py file, run "pip install openai==0.28" in the terminal prior to running the code to insure it is using the openai version that is compatable with the code. Openai's forums and website was very helpful with determining the chatgpt model that could process into the code without major bugs or crashing my computer so shoutout them. The forums were very helpful in understanding how to run the basic ai code and how to get the very very basic code off the ground. Would not have figured it out without those forums pushing me in the right direction and showing where certain aspects of the code, especially inporting openai in.
