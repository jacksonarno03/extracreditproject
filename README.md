User based chatbot with simple callback/response feedback loop. Very elementary and simple talk. Has one feature to go nerd about sharks when prompted with a keyword but I will leave that to be found. The code runs by you starting with a simple statement. Once that statement is made the chatbot will filter it though a series of __contains__ loops.
